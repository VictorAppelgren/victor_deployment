# SagaLabs Business Plan

> **Version**: 1.0 | January 2025
> **Status**: INTERNAL - Confidential
> **Purpose**: Foundation document for fundraising, strategy, and decision-making

## Executive Summary

**SagaLabs** is building the intelligence infrastructure for institutional capital allocation. We combine frontier AI with a proprietary knowledge graph to give investment professionals something they've never had: complete situational awareness of global markets, continuously updated, mapped to their specific positions.

**The Opportunity**: Human judgment remains irreplaceable in investment decisions, but human attention doesn't scale. No person can monitor every geopolitical development, every supply chain shift, every regulatory change across every market simultaneously. SagaLabs removes that ceiling.

**Current State**: We have a **working system** (not a demo) running 24/7, ingesting from 1000+ sources, with a knowledge graph containing millions of entity relationships. We have active pilot users and verbal letters of intent from hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers.

**The Ask**: We are raising **30-40M SEK** (~$3-4M USD) to scale our infrastructure, expand our team, and convert pilots to paying customers.

## 1. The Problem

### The Scale Ceiling

Investment professionals are brilliant. They've spent years—often decades—building mental models that give them an edge. Pattern recognition. Intuition. The ability to weigh what can't be quantified.

But there's a ceiling on how much one person can monitor:
- **Too many sources**: News, filings, social media, government announcements across every country
- **Too many entities**: Companies, commodities, currencies, political figures, regulations
- **Too many connections**: A policy shift in Chile affects lithium, which affects EV supply chains, which affects automotive stocks, which affects pension portfolios

### The Blind Spots

The risks that hurt portfolios aren't the ones being watched. They're the ones that weren't known to exist:
- A labor dispute in Finland cascades into European paper positions
- A drought in Taiwan builds toward a semiconductor shock
- A regulatory change in an obscure jurisdiction threatens an entire strategy

### The Current State

How do sophisticated investors handle this today?
1. **Bloomberg/Reuters**: Data, not intelligence. Tells you what happened, not what's building
2. **Research analysts**: Expensive, slow, limited coverage
3. **Alternative data**: Satellite imagery, credit card data—backward-looking signals
4. **Manual monitoring**: Unsustainable, incomplete, prone to recency bias

**The gap**: No one has built systematic, AI-powered, continuous monitoring of qualitative risks mapped to specific portfolio positions.

---

## 2. The Solution

### What SagaLabs Does

We built the intelligence layer that sits between the chaotic world and the investment decision:

1. **Continuous Ingestion**: 1000+ sources, multiple languages, 24/7 monitoring
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Millions of entities and relationships—companies, people, commodities, regulations, geographies
3. **AI Analysis**: Multiple frontier models working in concert to classify, connect, and assess
4. **Position Mapping**: Chain reactions traced to YOUR specific portfolio
5. **Living Intelligence**: Not a static report—analysis that evolves with every new piece of information

### The Core Insight

**AI can't do what humans do**. Pattern recognition built over decades. Intuition honed through experience. The judgment to weigh competing factors.

**Humans can't do what AI does**. Read everything. Connect everything. Monitor continuously. Never sleep.

**Together, they're unstoppable**. SagaLabs doesn't replace human judgment—it amplifies it. Your intuition now has the entire world to work with.

### Product Capabilities (Current)

- Real-time ingestion from 1000+ sources
- Knowledge graph with millions of entity relationships
- Multi-agent AI architecture (4-6 frontier models)
- Strategy-specific risk and opportunity analysis
- Chain reaction mapping (3-6 hops)
- Continuous thesis validation

### Product Capabilities (24-Month Target)

- Complete global coverage (all geographies, all languages)
- Every listed ticker + significant private companies
- All major asset classes
- Full regulatory tracking (every jurisdiction)
- Compliance module for institutional requirements
- API access for integration with existing workflows

---

## 3. Market Opportunity

### The Category We're Creating

We are NOT competing in:
- "Alternative data" ($10B+ market)—satellite imagery, credit card data
- "Risk management software" ($50B market)—backward-looking VaR systems

We ARE creating:
- **AI-Powered Qualitative Risk Intelligence**—turning unstructured world events into quantified portfolio threats

Think: **Palantir for investment decisions. Recorded Future for financial risk. Strategic Bloomberg.**

### Market Sizing (Bottom-Up)

| Segment | # of Firms | Addressable % | ACV (SEK) | Market Size |
|---------|------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Hedge Funds (Global) | 15,000 | 10% | 1,200,000 | 1.8B SEK |
| Family Offices | 10,000 | 15% | 1,200,000 | 1.8B SEK |
| Asset Managers | 5,000 | 10% | 2,400,000 | 1.2B SEK |
| Pension Funds | 2,000 | 5% | 2,400,000 | 240M SEK |
| **Total Addressable** | | | | **~5B SEK** |

**Our Target (Y2)**: 50-100 customers = 60-120M SEK ARR

### Why Now?

1. **AI Capability Inflection**: Frontier models can now do real analytical work, not just summarization
2. **Cost Collapse**: Compute costs dropping 10x every 18 months
3. **Market Complexity**: Geopolitical fragmentation, supply chain disruption, regulatory divergence
4. **Timing**: First mover in "agentic AI for institutional finance"

---

## 4. Business Model

### Pricing Strategy

**Primary Model**: Team License
- **100,000 SEK/month** (~$10,000 USD) for up to 10 users
- **1,200,000 SEK/year** (~$120,000 USD) annual contract

**Rationale**:
- Comparable to Bloomberg terminal pricing (~$25,000/user/year)
- Group pricing prevents internal friction ("who gets access?")
- Simpler sales conversation—one price, whole team
- Lower than enterprise alternatives, accessible to smaller firms

**Upsells**:
- Additional user blocks (10+ users)
- Premium data integrations
- Custom analysis modules
- API access for programmatic integration

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| ACV | 1,200,000 SEK | Team license, annual |
| Gross Margin | ~85% | 10% compute, 5% data per customer |
| CAC | ~100,000 SEK | Founder-led sales initially |
| LTV (5yr, 10% churn) | 4,300,000 SEK | ACV × 3.6 retention multiplier |
| LTV:CAC | 43x | Exceptional—target is >3x |
| Payback Period | <1 month | High ACV covers CAC immediately |

### Revenue Projections

**Conservative Model** (1 customer/month → 2 → 3 → 4 growth):

| Period | New Customers | Total Customers | Monthly MRR | ARR (Run Rate) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| M1-M6 | 1/month | 6 | 600K SEK | 7.2M SEK |
| M7-M12 | 2/month | 18 | 1.8M SEK | 21.6M SEK |
| M13-M18 | 3/month | 36 | 3.6M SEK | 43.2M SEK |
| M19-M24 | 4/month | 60 | 6.0M SEK | 72M SEK |

**Note**: This assumes minimal churn and single license per customer. Reality will likely include multi-license deals and some churn, but also faster ramp once product-market fit is proven.

| Aggressive | 40M SEK | 18% | 182M SEK | 222M SEK |

**Founder Preference**: Comfortable with 20-25% dilution. More important to raise sufficient capital than optimize for ownership percentage.

### Investor Profile

**Ideal Investors**:
- Swedish/Nordic VCs with fintech experience
- Angels from finance/trading backgrounds
- Family offices interested in co-investment
- Strategic investors (data providers, financial infrastructure)

**What We're Looking For**:
